1,School Dress Code Update,August 18 2020,Hampstead School has adopted a dress code for its students. The purpose of having a dress code for our children is to instill in them a sense of belonging and identity. A dress code is conducive to good behaviour and reflects the serious mission of our school. It fosters a positive educational atmosphere that promotes success. We ask for parentsâ€™ full cooperation in ensuring students adhere to the Hampstead School dress code policy.
